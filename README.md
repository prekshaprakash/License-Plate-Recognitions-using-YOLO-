# License-Plate-Recognitions-using-YOLO-

### This project focuses on License Plate Recognition using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model. It leverages YOLO's real-time detection capabilities to identify and extract license plates from images. The system can be applied to automated toll collection, parking management, and traffic monitoring, offering a reliable solution for vehicle identification. With YOLO's fast and accurate predictions, the model effectively handles various environments and lighting conditions, making it suitable for real-world applications.
